Insurance Classification

Instructions on how to run the code:

1) Install python3 packages - numpy, pandas, multiprocessing

2) Before you execute the app.py file, make sure the training and testing csv files are in the same folder.
If not, provide the path in the `insurance_training` and `insurance_testing_features` variables respectively.

3) As you start executing, if possible make sure that no other application is being executed as we are using multiprocessing.
Once the execution starts it will take about 7.5 minutes for training and predicting the values.

4) Use command:
	python3 app.py
